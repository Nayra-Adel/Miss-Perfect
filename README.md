# Miss-Perfect 
# "You dress, We suggest" (Hack4Girlz)
In an era of bullying and harassment against woman, In an era that treats woman as a "Miss Perfect" who is supposed to always look elegant even though through her hardest of days, In an era that only compares woman to each other rather than seeing each woman own charm, and In an era that suffers from economic problems that we don't have the luxury of doing lots of doing lots of shopping.

We tried to merge the instinct of our femininity To look fashionable with all the mentioned issues and came up with **"Your own stylist"**
